[1 2 3 4] = 1:4
linspace(first, last, number of elemnts)
' is the sign for transpose

Array Creating functions:
rand(2) 2X2 matrix of random numbers


indexing in matrix is not 0 based
x(3)   gives the 3rd number
x(2:4) gives 2nd 3rd and 4th number
end can be passed as an index: means the last element similar to what -1 does in numpy
if you use only one index with a matrix it will traverse down each column in order to find the index-th number
