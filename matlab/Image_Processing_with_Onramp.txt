Importing data:
imread
imshow
You can display two images together using the imshowpair function.
imwrite

Extracting color panes and intensity values:
size
images use the unsigned 8-bit integer (uint8) data type, which stores integers from 0 to 255
imsplit
montage({R,G,B})
im2gray
normalizing the brightness can be an important preprocessing step
investigate the contrast in an image: imhist()
increasing image contrast brigthens brighter pixels and darkens darker pixels
imadjust function to adjust the contrast of a grayscale image automatically.

To automate the threshold selection process, you can use the imbinarize function, 
which calculates the "best" threshold for the image
You can have imbinarize look at smaller portions of the image and 
pick the best threshold for that region by passing the "adaptive" 
option as the second argument to imbinarize.
gBinary = imbinarize(g,"adaptive");

In imbinarize, you can designate whether the foreground is bright 
or dark by setting the "ForegroundPolarity" option.

Segmentation can be improved in two ways: by preprocessing the image 
before binarizing and by postprocessing the binary image itself.

Filtering noise: Spatial filtering is a method using which we can weed out 
certain pixels that have absurd values in comparison to their neighbors

Many modern digital cameras (including mobile phone cameras) automatically 
increase the ISO in dim light. However, this increase in sensitivity 
amplifies noise picked up by the sensor, leaving the image grainy

Use the fspecial function to create an n-by-n averaging filter.
F = fspecial("average",n)
You can apply a filter F to an image I by using the imfilter function.
Ifltr = imfilter(I,F);

One way to remove text from an image is to use morphological operations.
